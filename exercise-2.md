### Exercise 2

We build RESTful API's to deliver financial and credit services to our clients.

We often consume RESTful API's from our partners and vendors to provide these products and services. For this exercise you will build a web application that performs a series of tasks against our API. We want to see how you would construct an application that involves multiple API steps in order to achieve a desired outcome.

##### The objectives are:

- Familiarize yourself with our API at https://docs.array.com and specifically the "Credit Report API Flow" guide.
- Create a web application in a private repository called `<lastname>-backend-2`.
- Build the necessary REST endpoints to: Create a user, retrieve questions, submit answers, and then order a credit report.
- Create a series of simple web pages to collect the user information, present the questions, and display the credit report upon successfully answering the questions.
- Inform the user of any errors during this process.
- Ask any questions you have in your Slack channel. We are happy to provide guidance and generally point you in the right direction.
- Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that allows us to build and start your project via `docker-compose up -d`. 

##### When complete:

Provide a link to your private repository to Phillip on Slack. Make sure your `README` includes how to start your application and anything we should know. Additionally, please include notes on any design choices you made throughout the exercise (dependencies, libraries, assumptions, etc.).

Lastly, in your `README`, please note how many hours you spent on the exercise.
